   *
   * This operation is also called "checkpointing" the replay

\section{Project Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The frontend is a good proxy for what is running in the background. In other words, visual updates are given to the user quickly after code runs in the background (quickly is subjective but probably less than 1s) 
    \item It is not feasible to store every instruction (or even close to it). As such, it must be sufficient to scan and build paths intelligently
    \item To detect differences, you must have both a positive and a negative of a branch. Never be able to detect regions of code that always execute the same way.
    \item W\^X circumvented with mprotect will guanratee that code section changes will not happen without an associated syscall. 
        \subitem I am not sure if this applies with double mapped pages.

\section{Use cases / Scenario}
\subsection{Date Gated Function}
\subsubsection{Description}
Part of an executable contains a check that ensures that certain code only runs when f(current\_time)==true. To start, f may be a simple operation such as x === 0 mod 10

You do not have access to the source and the binary has been compiled without debug symbols. You wish to understand exactly what the mechanism is that determines when the check passes and fails. 

Examples of this may include malware or programs that have timing bugs. After you have identified the code in question, it may be possible to manipulate it with other outside tools. 


\subsubsection{Required Functionality}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Replay the binary 
    \item Figure out screen recordings.
    \item Trace back where the instruction for manipulating the instruction is stored
    \item Identify similarity between multiple traces and highlight the divergence

\end{enumerate}
