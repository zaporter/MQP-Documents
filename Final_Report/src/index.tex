I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my professors for their unwavering support and guidance throughout my MQP. I am particularly grateful to Professor Pollice for his invaluable feedback and creativity, and to Professor Walls for our deep and passionate discussions. I am also deeply thankful for my housemates and their support and to my family for my love and encouragement.

I'm would never have started such an ambitious project without the support of everyone I have mentioned above, and for that I am eternally grateful.

%%========================%
%%   Inputting a table    %
%%========================%

%\begin{table}[!tb] % Use '!' to override the LaTeX table placement, 't' to place the table at the top of the page, and 'b' to place the table at the bottom of the page if the top does not work
%    \begin{center}
%        \begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
%            \hline
%            cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\ 
%            cell4 & cell5 & cell6 \\ 
%            cell7 & cell8 & cell9 \\ 
%            \hline
%        \end{tabular}
%        \caption{Caption of table} % Automatically adds a table number which updates as more tables are added to the paper
%        \label{table:label_of_table} % Used in the paper to reference the table and automatically includes the table number in the in-text reference.
%    \end{center}
%\end{table}

%\par To reference a table, you would simply say Table \ref{table:label_of_table}. By using the table label, the reference updates automatically as the paper is edited and more tables are added.

%\noindent Begin new section

%%========================%
%%   Inputting an image   %
%%========================%

%\par To add an image to the document, you first have to upload it to the file. To do so, click the "Upload" button on the top left of the screen (just below the "Menu" button, pictured in the figure below) and upload the image from your computer. 

%\begin{figure}[h] % Use 'h' to tell overleaf to place the image approximately 'here', meaning that you want it to be somewhere near where you are putting it in the text but will allow LaTeX to move it so that the overall format is best
%    \centering
%    % \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Images/upload_image.JPG} % Set the image width relative to the with of the text on the page and input the name of the image that is being placed.
%    \caption{Figure Caption} % Automatically adds a figure number which updates as more figures are added to the paper
%    \label{fig:label_of_figure} % Used in the paper to reference the figure and automatically includes the figure number in the in-text reference.
%\end{figure}

%\par To reference a figure, you would simply say Figure \ref{fig:label_of_figure}. By using the figure label, the reference updates automatically as the paper is edited and more figures are added.

%\section{Section Title}

%\noindent Begin new section

%%========================%
%% Inputting an equation  %
%%========================%

%% Use '\begin{equation}' to input a numbered equation. Used when equations will be reference in-text. Unlike tables, this equation will appear exactly where you put it in the text.

%\begin{equation} 
%    y=mx+b
%    \label{eq:equation_label}
%\end{equation}

%\par Once the equation is inputted, you can reference it similarly to tables using 'Equation \ref{eq:equation_label}'. Just like tables, the equation number update automatically when the paper is edited and new equations are added. 

%\par If you want to include an equation that is not numbered, use the form $$\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$$ and the equation will appear exactly where you put it in the sentence, in it's own line. 

%\par If you want to include an equation in a sentence without putting it in its own line, use the LaTeX 'math mode' using the form $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=r^{2}$.

%\section{Conclusion}

%\noindent Input your conclusion here. 

%\par Notes: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item The table of contents is set up with hyperlinks, and you can get to any section of the paper by clicking the section in the table of contents. Same for tables and figures. 
%    \item You can input as many sources as you want into the .bib file. They will only appear in the 'References' section if they are cited in text. The 'References' section is organized in the order of which the sources are cited in text. The in text citations are also hyperlinked, and clicking one will bring you to that source in the 'References' section. 
%    \item If you ever don't know how to do something, you can almost always find it on \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn} or just by Googling. 
%    \item The paper can be split into sections, subsections, and subsubsections, and subsubsubsections. These can be inputted in any part of the main body of the text, from the abstract to the conclusion. Adding an asterisks in the command line will prevent the section from getting a section number and appearing in the table of contents.
%    \item Appendices are referenced the same as anything else, using Appendix \ref{appendix:appendix_a_label} and Appendix \ref{appendix:appendix_b_label}.
%\end{enumerate}

\section{Appendix A Title}
\label{appendix:appendix_a_label}

Input materials for Appendix A. Works the same as regular text, just do not include captions or labels on any tables or figures. Appendices can be referenced in text the same way you reference figures or tables, using the label. 

\newpage

\section{Appendix B Title}
\label{appendix:appendix_b_label}

Input materials for Appendix B
