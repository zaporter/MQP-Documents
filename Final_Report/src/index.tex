I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my professors for their unwavering support and guidance throughout my MQP. I am particularly grateful to Professor Walls for our deep and passionate discussions, and to Professor Pollice for his invaluable feedback and real-world experience. I am also deeply thankful for my housemates and their support and to my family for my love and encouragement.

I'm would never have started such an ambitious project without the support of everyone I have mentioned above, and for that I am eternally grateful.
