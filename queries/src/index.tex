\section{Selection Refining}

Each section has a unique identifier (name)
Section definition: Option<start,end> ($\cup$ selection..)* ($\cap$ selection...)*

To refine a selection, you can give the engine hints:
Select only code that satisfies the following properties:
- It was run at least x times: [default: 1, min: 1]
- It was not run more than x times: default:[infinity]
- It is in x section 
- It is not in {x} section
-it happens on x thread 


\section{Branches}
In english: "Between time x and y, select all instructions that cause a different path of execution"
Options:
- Thread aware: default:true
- Time ranges (two)
What this really means:
- If there is a branch, ensure that it is not just because of a thread swap
- Dont show all the spots where they are different. Ignore the start and the end. 
- 


Between time x and y, show me the areas of memory that were touched and are the same vs different 
sequential vs at start (parallel)

Show me all instructions that modify different areas of memory between the two sections 


In english: Give me a spot to instrument, instrument it.
Make me angry
