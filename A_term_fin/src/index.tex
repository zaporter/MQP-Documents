\section{Problem Statement}

It is currently difficult to identify the flow of "program-level"/macro logic from static or even dynamic analysis. 

\section{Goal Statement}

I hope to use record and replay technology to allow researchers to move easily peer into a binary to find important addresses and to identify the most important instructions for "program-level" logic.

\section{Minimum A-Term Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
\begin{todolist}
\item[\done] Code capable of tracing data through a program's execution 
\item[\done] A plan for comparing the traces and identifying shared points between traces
\item[\done] A platform for my UI that I am comfortable with
\item[\done] Recording infastructure to support scrubbing along the timeline of a program
\item[\done] Tests for all code I have written (within reason)
\item Documentation for all code that reasonably requires documentation 
\item An example use case to demonstrate value
\end{todolist}
\end{itemize}

\section{Revised use case}
Capturing functions from other programs. 

$f(a*) \to b$

\subsection{Acrobat PDF Viewer}
Suppose that you have a very complicated 

\subsection{Zoom Get Personal Meeting Room ID}

How to use: 
Start zoom via MQPProj
Signin using auth method (username, pw)
Navigate to personal page
Unhide your personal meeting room id. 
Close.

Start MQPProj on recording that was just created. 
Scrub start of timeline to before signin 
Scrub end of timeline to seeing your personal room ID.
Indicate to MQPProj the function input (username, pw)
Indicate to MQPProj the output of the function (personal meeting room id)
Have it generate an executable for $f(username,pw) \to personal meeting room id$
